Whistler is a Lisp parser and (eventually) evaluator, written in Ruby.

Why?  Because I wanted to write one.

Whistler isn't meant to compete with, or replace, or whatever, any other
Lisps written in Ruby, or to serve any practical purpose.  It's entirely
pedagogical.

The main idea (at the moment) is to have a basic parser that yields
tokens to a parser/AST evaluator, and then write different parsers/AST
evaluators.
